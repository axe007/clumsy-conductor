# Code of conduct

## Introduction
Our team Group 16 is committed to fostering a positive, respectful, and inclusive environment where everyone can learn, 
collaborate, and contribute to the project's success. This Code of Conduct outlines the expectations we have for team 
members and provides guidelines for acceptable behavior.

## Core Values
* **Respect:** Treat everyone with kindness, empathy, and consideration.
* **Collaboration:** Work together to achieve common goals, valuing everyone's input and expertise.
* **Integrity:** Be honest, transparent, and accountable for your actions and decisions.
* **Professionalism:** Maintain a high standard of conduct, punctuality, and dedication to the project.
* **Continuous Learning:** Embrace opportunities to learn, grow, and adapt to new challenges.

## Expected Behavior
* Communicate openly, honestly, and respectfully.
* Actively participate in meetings and discussions.
* Complete tasks and assignments on time and to the best of your ability.
* Be open to feedback and use it constructively.
* Provide support and assistance to fellow team members when needed.
* Abide by academic integrity standards and refrain from plagiarism, cheating, or dishonesty.
 
## Unacceptable Behavior
* Harassment, discrimination, or exclusion based on race, gender, religion, age, disability, or sexual orientation.
* Disrespectful or derogatory language, gestures, or actions.
* Publicly sharing confidential team information without permission.
* Intentionally undermining the efforts or reputation of team members or the project.
* Procrastinating or consistently failing to meet deadlines.

## Ensuring individual contributions
* Every contribution that is possible to version control will be tracked by creating issues on the Gitlab. These will 
be assigned to the respective developer and moved forward from TO-DO to Closed using Git.
* For the administrative tasks kept on Trello, we assign individual team members to the tasks and move these from Doing to Done.
* We are further using a Google shared space to upload constant reports of the work being done. The report goes into a 
spreadsheet that is shared among the members in the group, making it possible to stay informed about the work of the others.
* The team will handle individual assignments as a group task in terms of management on the teams board. This does not 
mean that the individual assignments will be solved as a group activity but rather that the issue concerning the individual 
assignments will be completed once all team members' individual assignments are completed. 

## Knowledge transfer
* Encourage and conduct a pair programming
* Share links of knowledge sources to our Trello board into "Information Superhub".
* During the sessions and meetings with voice communication through Discord will have opportunities to ask questions and 
figure out answers together unless someone can answer immediately. 
* Exercise a good commenting practice in our code to ensure that everyone understands what is going on and as a result to 
have knowledge shared.
* Turn questions and problems into practical documents with information, templates etc. and add links to those in the
"Information Superhub" on our Trello board.

## Communication plan
* Our main communication platform will be Trello board, and Canvas. 
* Team meetings will be held via Discord or Zoom on Mondays and Fridays, on campus after the lecture on Wednesdays every week 
to discuss open issues from the Gitlab issues board and Trello board.
* Specifically on Tuesdays the team will agree on a plan for the week's tasks and assign team members to those tasks - 
following the template for weekly meetings.
* The team will use a dedicated Discord channel for lecture times, post-lecture meetings, meetings, deadlines of 
assignments and other time-related issues.
* These meetings will also include stand-up meetings where the team will receive updates on the current tasks from team 
members are working on and their plans to accomplish before the next meeting or related deadline.
* Furthermore, team members will be available on Discord outside meeting hours to provide assistance to other team members
who may be experiencing difficulties with their tasks.
* Communication between pairs for pair programming will be determined by each pair on where and when they will carry out their tasks.

## Conflict prevention
* At the beginning of the project, each team member will be assigned specific roles and responsibilities based on their skills and expertise. This will help in setting clear expectations for each member, reducing the chances of misunderstandings and conflict. A questionaire regarding familiarity of each member toward different toolset was issued and assessed together from the moment the group was formed.
* In addition to the weekly meetings, team members are encouraged to have regular check-ins with each other to share updates, ask for help, and discuss any concerns. This will help in addressing any issues before they escalate into conflicts. All underlying problems are encouraged to be discussed openly as soon as possible before it can evolve into further problems.
* Create a culture where team members feel comfortable providing and receiving constructive feedback. This will help in identifying potential issues early on and addressing them before they escalate into conflicts. If any conflict emerge, the conflicy resolution policy is referred to.  

## Conflict resolution 
* Discussions on progress and assigning tasks will be done during the weekly meetings. If there are conflicting opinions
regarding progress and assignment of tasks the team will vote and the option with the most votes will be the option that 
the team moves forward with. If there is a stalemate, the team will use flip-a-coin, rock-paper-scissor or play a good 
spirited game to decide what option to take. 
* Preferably discussions and decisions that need to be addressed will be left to this meeting and other decisions that 
might come up will be up to the developers themselves to solve. 
* Given the situation where a lot of work is being done over the internet, to avoid that conflicts arise out of 
misunderstandings it is essential to follow our communication plan and document on Trello board.
* If any of the team members feels that another team member is not contributing as expected, the team member should 
address this during the weekly meeting. If there has not been any improvement in contribution by the next weekly meeting,
this should be addressed once again. If there's yet again no improvement in contribution by the following meeting, the
course coordinator will be contacted and informed of the issue. The team member who has not been contributing will be 
informed that the course coordinator has been contacted. 

## Template for weekly meetings
* How is everyone feeling? Hope everyone feels happy and engaged.
* What has been done since last week or last meeting? 
    * What things worked well
    * What did not work well
* Discuss non-closed issues in doing-columns
* Discuss issues in open-columns  for coming week (clarify, scrap and assign)
* Go through group assignments for the next 2 weeks
* Agree on immediate tasks and verify next meeting schedule
